#  This file specifies the versions and variants for HPCToolkit's
#  dependency packages and serves as a common reference point for how
#  to build them.  It also specifies the paths or modules for system
#  build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid rebuilding them.
#
#  Put this file in one of spack's configuration scope directories,
#  normally either <spack-root>/etc/spack, or else in its own,
#  separate directory (and then use 'spack -C dir').
#
#  There are two main sections: (1) hpctoolkit dependency specs,
#  and (2) system build tools: cmake, perl, python, MPI and GCC.

  # 1 -- HPCToolkit Prerequisite Packages
  #------------------------------------------------------------

  # This section contains hpctoolkit's prerequisites, recommended
  # versions and necessary variants.  For most packages, the most
  # recent version will work.
  #
  # Note: the following packages have variants that may need changing
  # for your local system.
  #
  #   1. boost -- avoid 1.68.0, it breaks the build in hpctoolkit.
  #   1.66.0 is good for all dyninst revs.
  #
  #   2. dyninst -- use version 9.3.2 for Blue Gene with the default
  #   gcc 4.4 compilers.  (not recommended)
  #
  #   3. elfutils -- 0.176 doesn't build on Blue Gene, use 0.175.
  #
  #   4. intel-tbb -- add '~tm' for AMD, Xeon Phi (KNL, etc), and very
  #   old Intel systems that don't support transactional memory.
  #
  #   5. libmonitor -- add '+bgq' on Blue Gene/Q.
  #
  #------------------------------------------------------------


  #  cuda:
  #    modules:
  #    #  cuda@10.1:  cuda/10.1
  #    buildable: False
  #    #
  #    version:  [10.2]


  # dyninst -- used in hpcstruct for line map info, inline sequences
  # and loop analysis.
  #
  # Need >= 10.1.0 for full cuda CFG support.
  # On Blue Gene, with default gcc 4.4 compilers, use version 9.3.2.
  #
  # +openmp is to support openmp threads in parseapi.
  #
  dyninst:
    version:  [develop]
    variants: +openmp build_type=RelWithDebInfo



  # MPI -- hpctoolkit always supports profiling MPI applications.
  # Adding MPI here is only for building hpcprof-mpi, the MPI version
  # of hpcprof.
  #
  # Normally, you want MPI from a module (mpich, mvapich, openmpi)
  # that was built for the correct interconnect system for the compute
  # nodes.  Also, for hpcprof-mpi, MPI should be built with GNU
  # gcc/g++ and the same version used to build hpctoolkit (to keep the
  # C++ libraries in sync).
  #
  openmpi:
    modules:
      openmpi@4.0.0:  openmpi-gnu/4.0
    buildable: False
