#  This file specifies the versions and variants for HPCToolkit's
#  dependency packages and serves as a common reference point for how
#  to build them.  It also specifies the paths or modules for system
#  build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid rebuilding them.
#
#  Put this file in one of spack's configuration scope directories,
#  normally either <spack-root>/etc/spack, or else in its own,
#  separate directory (and then use 'spack -C dir').
#
#  There are two main sections: hpctoolkit dependency specs and system
#  build tools: cmake, perl, python, MPI and GCC.

packages:

  # dyninst -- used in hpcstruct for line map info, inline sequences
  # and loop analysis.
  #
  # Need >= 10.0 or develop for best parseapi and CFG support.  On
  # Blue Gene, with the default gcc 4.4 compilers, use version 9.3.2.
  #
  # +openmp is to support openmp threads in parseapi.
  dyninst:
    version:  [develop]
    variants: +openmp build_type=RelWithDebInfo

  # MPI -- hpctoolkit always supports profiling MPI applications.
  # Adding MPI here is only for building hpcprof-mpi, the MPI version
  # of hpcprof.
  #
  # Normally, you want MPI from a module (mpich, mvapich, openmpi)
  # that was built for the correct interconnect system for the compute
  # nodes.  Also, for hpcprof-mpi, MPI should be built with GNU
  # gcc/g++ and the same version used to build hpctoolkit (to keep the
  # C++ libraries in sync).
  #
  openmpi:
    modules:
      openmpi@3.1.0:  spectrum-mpi/rolling-release
    buildable: True

  # CUDA -- should match the installed version
  cuda:
    paths:
      cuda@10.2: /usr/local/cuda
    buildable: False
