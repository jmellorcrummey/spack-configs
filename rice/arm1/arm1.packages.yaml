#
#  This file specifies the versions and variants for HPCToolkit's
#  dependency packages and serves as a common reference point for how
#  to build them.  It also specifies the paths or modules for system
#  build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid rebuilding them.
#
#  Put this file in one of spack's configuration scope directories,
#  normally either <spack-root>/etc/spack, or else in its own,
#  separate directory (and then use 'spack -C dir').
#
#  There are two main sections: hpctoolkit dependency specs and system
#  build tools: cmake, perl, python, MPI and GCC.

packages:

  # hpctoolkit -- these settings can be specified here or else on the
  # spack install command line.
  #
  # Use version 'develop' for the latest snapshot from master.
  #
  # +mpi builds hpcprof-mpi (requires mpi).
  # +papi uses papi instead of perfmon.
  
  # dyninst -- used in hpcstruct for line map info, inline sequences
  # and loop analysis.
  #
  # Need >= 10.0 or develop for best parseapi and CFG support.  On
  # Blue Gene, with the default gcc 4.4 compilers, use version 9.3.2.
  #
  # +openmp is to support openmp threads in parseapi.
  #
  dyninst:
    version:  [develop]
    variants: +openmp build_type=RelWithDebInfo
