# This is the spack packages file, CONFIGURED for msi3 on ufront.cs.rice.edu
#
#
#  packages.yaml
#
#  This file specifies the versions and variants for HPCToolkit's
#  dependency packages and serves as a common reference point for how
#  to build them.  It also specifies the paths or modules for system
#  build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid rebuilding them.
#
#  Put this file in one of spack's configuration scope directories:
#    1. <spack-root>/etc/spack -- applies to this spack repo
#    2. <home-dir>/.spack -- applies to any spack on this machine
#    3. any dir -- applies with 'spack -C dir' argument
#
#  There are three sections: (1) regular hpctoolkit dependency specs,
#  (2) gpu and MPI specs, and (3) system build tools: cmake, perl,
#  python and GCC.

packages:

  # If you want to specify a generic target or a specific compiler for
  # all builds, then you can set those here.  For example, a generic
  # target might be useful for a shared install acrosss multiple
  # machine types.
  #
  # generic families: aarch64, ppc64, ppc64le, x86_64
  #
  # Selecting a specific provider for a virtual package (eg, openmpi
  # for mpi) also goes here under 'all'.
  #
  # all:
  #   target: ['x86_64','ppc64','ppc64le','aarch64']
  #   compiler: [gcc@8.3.1]
  #   providers:
  #     mpi: [openmpi]


  # hpctoolkit -- these settings can be specified here or else on the
  # spack install command line.
  #
  # Use version 'master' for the latest snapshot from master.
  # Version 'develop' is for pre-release features.
  # 2019.12.28 is the last version that runs on Blue Gene.
  #
  # +mpi builds hpcprof-mpi (requires mpi).
  # +papi uses papi instead of perfmon (now default).
  # +viewer also installs hpcviewer (default).
  # +cuda, +rocm for GPU support.
