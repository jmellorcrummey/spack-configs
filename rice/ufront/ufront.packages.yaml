#
#
#  This file specifies the versions and variants for HPCToolkit's
#  dependency packages and serves as a common reference point for how
#  to build them.  It also specifies the paths or modules for system
#  build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid rebuilding them.
#
#  Put this file in one of spack's configuration scope directories:
#    1. <spack-root>/etc/spack -- applies to this spack repo
#    2. <home-dir>/.spack -- applies to any spack on this machine
#           for this user
#    3. any dir -- applies with 'spack -C dir' argument
#
#  There are three sections: (1) regular hpctoolkit dependency specs,
#  (2) GPU and MPI specs, and (3) system build tools: cmake, perl,
#  python and GCC.

packages:

  # If you want to specify a generic target or a specific compiler for
  # all builds, then you can set those here.  For example, a generic
  # target might be useful for a shared install acrosss multiple
  # machine types.
  #
  # generic families: aarch64, ppc64, ppc64le, x86_64
  #
  # Selecting a specific provider for a virtual package (eg, openmpi
  # for mpi) also goes here under 'all'.
  #
  all:
  #   target: [x86_64]
    compiler: [gcc@11.3.0]
  #   providers:
  #     mpi: [openmpi]
    variants:
    - cuda_arch=80
    - amdgpu_target=gfx906,gfx908,gfx90a


  # Note: settings in this file are only preferences, not hard
  # requirements.  If spack chooses a different version or variant,
  # you can force spack to use your version with the new 'require:'
  # field.  Require takes a single, full spec and supersedes both
  # version and variant and should always be quoted.
  #
  # dyninst:
  #   require: "@12.2.0 +openmp"


  # hpctoolkit -- these settings can be specified here or else on the
  # spack install command line.
  #
  # Version 'develop' is now the main line of development for
  # recommended versions.
  #
  # +mpi builds hpcprof-mpi (requires mpi).
  # +papi uses papi instead of perfmon (now default).
  # +viewer also installs hpcviewer (default).
  # +cuda, +rocm for GPU support.
