#  CUSTOMIZED for msi3 on gpu.cs

#  packages.yaml
#
#  This file specifies the versions and variants for HPCToolkit's
#  dependency packages and serves as a common reference point for how
#  to build them.  It also specifies the paths or modules for system
#  build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid rebuilding them.
#
#  Put this file in one of spack's configuration scope directories,
#  normally either <spack-root>/etc/spack, or else in its own,
#  separate directory (and then use 'spack -C dir').
#
#  There are two main sections: (1) hpctoolkit dependency specs,
#  and (2) system build tools: cmake, perl, python, MPI and GCC.
