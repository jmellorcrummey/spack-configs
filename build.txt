--------------------
To build hpctoolkit:
--------------------

First, do a spack install, with the latest spack repo, to get the dependencies.

INITIAL BUILD
-------------
1.  Get the sources:
    To create a new branch:
	git clone https://github.com/hpctoolkit/hpctoolkit.git
	git branch xyz (If you want to create the branch, not otherwise)
	git checkout xyz
	git push --set-upstream origin xyz
	git pull	

    To use an existing branch:
	git clone https://github.com/hpctoolkit/hpctoolkit.git -b <branch>

2.  Construct the build area:
	cd hpctoolkit
	mkdir BUILD

3.  Configure the build (in the BUILD directory):
    cd BUILD
    ../configure --with-spack=<spack-install-packages-directory> --prefix=<build.out> --enable-develop <other-options>

      <spack-install-packages-directory> is a subdirectory of the directory named in
	the install_tree setting in the config.yaml file used for the spack
	install command.  The subdirectory is the one that contains the packages,
	and it is two levels down below the install_tree, at <install-tree>/<OS-spec>/<gcc-version>/
	It is specified as an absolute path, since configure does not recognize ~ as your home directory.

      <build.out> is the absolute path to wherever you want the build installed

      <other-options> specify additional options for the build.  They include
	--with-rocm=<path to rocm>  You can find it by loading the module and doing "which hipcc".
	    The <path to rocm> is "which hipcc", with bin/hipcc removed from it.

	--with-cuda=<path to cuda>  You can find it by loading the module and doing "which nvcc".
	    The <path to cuda> is "which nvcc", with bin/nvcc removed from it.

	    You may want --with-cupti=<path to cupti>, but only if you do not want the cupti that comes with cuda
	    or if with cuda you set does not have a cupti.

	--without-cuda  -- needed currently for hpclink to work

	MPICXX=<path to mpi compiler>  ( no -- in the argument)

4.  Run the build (in the BUILD directory):
	cd BUILD
	make install

    The non-parallel build is relatively fast, at least compared to a spack install.
    You can run the builds in parallel, but if there's an error, it's harder to see where
	make -j 4 install 


MAKING CHANGES
--------------
If you only change source file contents, you should only need to rerun the make install.

For more serious changes, such as adding files or directories;

1. Ensure you have the right version of autotools:
	git clone https://github.com/hpctoolkit/hpctoolkit-devtools
	mkdir ~/autotools
	cd hpctoolkit-devtools/autotools
	./make.sh ~/autotools

    Add to your path in ~/.bashrc:
	export PATH=~/autotools/bin:$PATH
	source ~/.bashrc

    This only needs to be done on systems where you are changing the structure of the repo.

2.  Edit configure.ac and any Makefile.am's as appropriate to add the files/directories.

3.  Reconstruct the Makefiles, etc.:
	cd hpctoolkit
	autogen
	/bin/rm -rf BUILD; mkdir BUILD; cd BUILD
	../configure [as in the initial instructions above, in 3]

4.  Run the build:
	make install [as in the initial instructions above, in 4]

If you are editing a *.in file that is used to build a script, you will need to run "configure",
in the top-level source directory.  However, if you run "autogen" in the top-level source directory,
the next invocation of "make install" will run it automagically..

When in doubt, run "autogen", but be sure you have the right autotools.
