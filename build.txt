--------------------
To build hpctoolkit:
--------------------
1.  Get the sources:
	git clone https://github.com/hpctoolkit/hpctoolkit.git hpctoolkit
	cd hpctoolkit
	    Then, pick the branch you want; for the fnbounds branch:
	git branch fnbounds
	git checkout fnbounds
	git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/fnbounds fnbounds
	git pull	

2.  Construct the build area:
	mkdir BUILD
	cd BUILD

3.  Configure the build
	    (in the BUILD directory)
	../configure --with-spack=<-spack-install-packages-directory> --prefix=<build.out> --enable-develop

4.  Run the build:
	    (in the hpctoolkit-build directory)
	make -j 4 install

If you change any source files, you should only need to rerun the make install

If you want to add or delete source files, or make changes to the build, you need to edit
the changes into the Makefile.am in the directory where you are making the changes, and run "autogen".

If you are editing a *.in file that is used to build a script, you will need to run "configure",
in the top-level source directory.  However, if you run "autogen" in the top-level source directory,
the next invocation of "make install" will run it automagically..

When in doubt, run "autogen".
