This directory contains a two subdirectories, each of which has subdirectories for
simple end-to-end tests for hpctoolkit.

The set of tests contained here is not by any means a stress test;
rather it is closer to a smoke test.  The user should be able to scan
each test and verify that the data is plausible, and matches the expected behavior.

The test are based on simple programs that do relatively few operations and are intended
to allow a user to understand their behavior, and predict the performance measurements expected.

The two top-level subdirectories are "cpu" and "gpu".

"cpu" contains a README, a source file, and subdirectories for testcpu and hwccpu.
The README file describes the behavior of the simple program, the output expected,
and what one can expect to see in hpcviewer on an experiment on that program.

"gpu" contains a README, a source file, and subdirectories for gccnvidia, llvmnvidia, and aompamd.
The README file describes the behavior of the simple program, the output expected,
and what one can expect to see in hpcviewer on an experiment on that program.

The Makefile in each subdirectory of both "cpu" and "gpu" has a number of targets:

	"make" : build the simple program.

	"make run : run the program by itself.

	"make hpct" : run the program with appropiate data collection for that test
		The run incorporates hpcrun, hpcstruct, and hpcprof, and results in a
		database that can be looked at with hpcviewer.

	"make clean" : remove everything except the built program.

	"make clobber" : remove everything, leaving only the sources, Makefile, and README, if any.

The gpu/*nvidia Makefile's have an additional target:

	"make hpctpc" : run the program and collect gpu data with PC sampling.

If you add additional directories with tests, please follow these conventions.

If you choose to run these tests directly from the repository, please be sure to run
"make clobber" in every subdirectory before pushing to to the master.
