This directory contains a set of simple end-to-end tests for hpctoolkit.
The set of tests contained here is not by any means a stress test;
rather it is closer to a smoke test.  The user should be able to scan
each test and verify that the data is plausible, and matches the expected behavior.

Each directory contains one or more source files, and a Makefile for a simple program.
Those simple programs do a relatively few operations and are intended to allow a user
to understand their behavior, and predict the performance measurements expected.

Each directory also contains a README file describing the behavior of the simple program, the
output expected, and what one can expect to see in hpcviewer on an experiment on that program.

The Makefile in each directory has a number of targets, with behavior as described below:

	"make" : build the simple program.

	"make run : run the program by itself.

	"make hpct" : run the program with appropiate data collection for that test
		The run incorporates hpcrun, hpcstruct, and hpcprof, and results in a
		database that can be looked at with hpcviewer.

	"make clean" : remove everything except the built program.

	"make clobber" : remove everything, leaving only the sources, Makefile, and README.

Some Makefile's have other targets for end-to-end runs with different options.

If you add additional directories with tests, please follow these conventions.

If you choose to run these tests directly from the repository, please be sure to run
"make clobber" in every subdirectory before pushing to to the master.
